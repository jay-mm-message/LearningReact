I would recommend "create-react-app", simply "CRA". 
"CRA" handles the most of the build configurations and they are hidden by default
 so you can focus on code. ( In some specific cases, 
 you can eject and customize it by running commands "eject")


You can create the project using below command
(# yarn create react-app <app_name>)

# yarn create react-app my-app

To start the project simply run below commands

# yarn start

To build projects

# yarn build

You can eject the project with below command

# yarn eject
